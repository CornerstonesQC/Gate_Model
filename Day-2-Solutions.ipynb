    "> **Bonus 1.5:** We are often interested in the resource requirements of quantum circuits, especially in the present era where operations are noisy, and coherence times of qubits are low. Common metrics of circuit quality are width (number of qubits), depth (number of sequential operations that cannot be parallelized), and the number of specific types of gates, especially 2-qubit gates. For the `GHZ_n` circuit you wrote above, what are the width, depth, and gate counts in terms of $n$?"
